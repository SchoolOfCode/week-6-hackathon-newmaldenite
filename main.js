// Greetings Adventurer! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is simple:
// 
// Find which London Underground stations are entirely underground!
// 
// While this sounds mad, 60% of the London Underground is actually above ground;
// only a few stations have no buildings above ground.
//
// You've been provided with a dataset in the form of the { zone1Stations } object.
// This has information about (nearly) all the stations in Zone 1.
// 
// Your task is to query the object and return an array containing all the stations
// with a 'null' RoofRepair property - why repair the roof if you don't have one!
// 
// Good luck!
